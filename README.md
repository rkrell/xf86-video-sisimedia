X11 video driver for SiS 671/771 cards

This driver is written by Thomas Winischhofer and is a (nearly) complete re-write of a driver written for the SiS6326 and SiS530 by  Alan Hourihane and others.

This is especially dedicated to all folks reanimating old laptops with SIS Mirage S3 graphics cards, like the Fujitsu Esprimo V5335.

I picked up the original source code and applied all patches to avoid a patching hell during packaging.
